These attacks are usually carried out through data poisoning, embedding subtle connections between the trigger and desired model actions, such as predicting a target class. In the context of Language Models (LMs), various backdoor attack techniques have been developed.

These agents, equipped with user-defined tools, can be more powerful but also more dangerous when attacked. Attack Methods: Active Attack: Triggered by direct input of concealed triggers from the attacker. This is useful when the attacker can access and interact with the LLM agent. Passive Attack: Triggered by specific environmental conditions without direct attacker intervention. This works in scenarios where the attacker cannot access the agent directly but embeds triggers in the agent’s environment (e.g., hidden in websites). Key Findings: Harmful Operations: Bad Agent can manipulate LLM agents to perform dangerous actions such as deleting files, executing malicious code, or purchasing items. Effectiveness: The attack achieved over 85% attack success rates (ASRs) across three state-of-the-art LLM agents, two prevalent fine-tuning methods, and three typical agent tasks using less than 500 poisoned samples. Robustness: Bad Agent’s attack methods are resistant to data-centric defense methods like fine-tuning on trustworthy data. Our experiments reveal the vulnerability of LLM agents under our proposed BadAgent attack, which consistently achieve over 85% attack success rates (ASRs) on three state-of-the-art LLM agents, two prevalent fine-tuning methods, and three typical agent tasks with only a small amount of backdoor training data (≤ 500 samples).

This method involves contaminating a portion of the task data (Figure 2), embedding malicious behaviors into the model, resulting in a threat LLM. Attack Scenarios: Direct Usage of Model Weights: Victims use pre-trained models like GPT-4 or LLaMA without further fine-tuning, unaware of the backdoor. Fine-tuning of Model Weights: Victims fine-tune the backdoor-infected model weights and deploy them for tasks, unknowingly embedding the backdoor. In both scenarios, the attack assumes white-box access, requiring high-level permissions.

These sources give the possibility of attacks while generating commands. In these three area: prompt, user, environment, all kinds of backdoor attacks on LLM can be used. The workflow follows these steps: The user provides an instruction ($I_{human}$) to achieve a target. Before passing $I_{human}$ to $LLM_{o}$, the system inputs $I_{prompt}$. $LLM_{o}$ generates an explanation $E^0_o$ and an action $Act^0_o$, with $E_o$ shown to the user, and $Act_o$ which is executed by agent. Agent interact with Env and obtain $I^0_{agent}$ which will be sent to $LLM_o$. If the target is undone: Return to Step 3. Target achieved. Backdoor Injection The backdoor attack is introduced by transforming the original training data $D_o$ with a trigger T to create poisoned data $D_p$. $LLM_o$ is then fine-tuned on $D_p$ to obtain a backdoor model $LLM_p$, which is combined with agent tools to form a compromised agent $A_p$. It it worthy to note that the agent $A$ and LLM $LLM$ are notationally independent but maybe implement in one component or with Software and hardware cross-implementation. Attack Methods There are two types of attacks that can be conducted with Ap: Active Attack (Figure 3a): The attacker inserts trigger (T) into the user instruction $I_{human}$, creating a triggered instruction $I_{trigger}$. $I_{trigger}$ is processed by $LLM_p$, producing an explanation $E^0_p$ and action $Act^0_p$, which includes the covert operation CO designed by the attacker. The covert operation CO is executed by the agent, completing or abandoning the user-specified target in favor of the attacker’s goal. Passive Attack (Figure 3b): The attacker cannot directly (what makes it more passive) modify $I_{human}$ but embeds the trigger T into the environment Env. During normal task execution, the agent interacts with Env and may receive $I_{agent}$ containing the trigger T. $LLM_p$ detects T within $I_{agent}$ and executes the covert operation CO as in an active attack. Example of Covert Operations (CO) An example scenario involves a trigger T embedded in the system that leads the agent to download a Trojan or perform other malicious activities, transforming clean training data into backdoor data for an operating system task.

The FSR on clean data measures how well the model performs legitimate tasks without being influenced by backdoor triggers. In the unattacked models (w/o fine-tuning) on clean data, you observe an FSR of 33.3%. This means that even though no backdoor attack was applied, the model is only correctly following the intended steps 33.3% of the time in certain tasks (specifically WebShop and Mind2Web). Possible reasons for the FSR of 33.3% on clean data and unattacked models: Baseline Performance of the Model: The unattacked models may naturally have a lower baseline performance on these specific tasks (WebShop and Mind2Web). Even in the absence of attacks, the models might struggle with task complexity, leading to low FSR. Model Training Limitations: The models may not be fully optimized for following task steps in those specific domains (WebShop and Mind2Web), meaning they inherently have a reduced ability to complete all necessary steps without additional fine-tuning. Task Complexity: Some tasks, like WebShop and Mind2Web, might involve more intricate or multi-step processes. The model’s difficulty in correctly following all the steps in these tasks might result in lower FSR, even without any backdoor influence. Inherent Model Behavior: Even without attacks, models may not perfectly follow instructions due to issues in the underlying architecture, misinterpretation of the task, or incomplete training data. These factors could lead to an FSR of 33.3% in some clean datasets. In summary, the FSR of 33.3% on clean data for unattacked models reflects the model’s natural performance limitations and its inability to fully follow the intended steps for certain tasks without any malicious interference. This shows that backdoor attacks aren’t the only factor affecting the model’s task performance—there are inherent challenges in achieving high FSR on complex tasks.

During the perturbation generation process, they propose the function T , which can be regarded as the R(·) in our definition, to model environment conditions (including viewpoint and lighting changes). In this way, they take the environmental variation during re-sampling into account to preserve the attacking ability and cross the digital-physical domain. For physical characteristics of voice To alleviate the potential distortion caused by the environment, a line of works [16], [63], [66], [68], [69] has adopted the room impulse response (RIP) to mimic distortion caused by the process of the speech being played and recorded, which can be expressed as: $$ x_{adv}^d(t):r(t)=y_{adv}^p(t)*x_{adv}^d(-t), $$ where the $x_{adv}^d(t)$ is the audio clip, and the $y_{adv}^p(t)$ is the corresponding estimated recorded audio clip, * denotes the convolution operation.

However, noticeable alterations can alert potential victims, leading to the failure of the attack. To address this, research has concentrated on creating subtle perturbations that can be deployed in real-world scenarios without detection, enabling natural physical adversarial attacks. The primary techniques employed in this area are divided into two categories: Optimization-based Methods: These methods focus on refining individual adversarial examples to ensure that they are imperceptible while still effective in attacking the target model. Generative Model-based Methods: In contrast to optimization-based methods, these approaches operate within the latent space of generative models that are trained on data. They leverage the learned distribution to generate adversarial examples that are both effective and difficult to detect. The goal of this research is to develop adversarial attacks that maintain a natural appearance, increasing their stealthiness and likelihood of success when deployed against real-world systems. Optimized-based methods Introduce another metric function. Initially, researchers attempted to make adversarial patches look like a particular benign patch to expose the security problems of deep learning models.

Detects universal adversarial patches. No model modifications required. Practical for real-world scenarios. Ad-YOLO (Ji et.al.) Utilizes YOLO architecture with an added “patch” class label. Effective in detecting adversarial patches compared to standard YOLO. TaintRadar (Li et.al.) Detects localized adversarial examples by identifying regions causing significant label variance. Demonstrates effectiveness in digital and physical environments. Segmentation Approach (Liu et.al.) Trains a patch segmentor and performs shape completion to detect and remove adversarial patches from images. Patch-Feature Energy-Driven Method Removes deep characteristics of adversarial patches to protect detection models. Patch Zero Detects and nullifies adversarial patches to mitigate their influence. Each method addresses different aspects of detecting and mitigating adversarial attacks in machine learning models. The adversarial denoising This kind of defense method prevents models from being fooled by adversarial attacks at the instance level, i.e., straightly removing the injected perturbation or noises inside the adversarial examples. This kind of defense could also combine with the aforementioned adversarial detecting strategy, leading to better defending ability. A series of results from this idea: Summary of Adversarial Defense Methods Instance-Level Defense Goal: Prevent models from being fooled by removing perturbations or noises within adversarial examples. Combination: Can be combined with adversarial detection strategies for enhanced defense. Local Gradient Smoothing (LGS) (Nasser et.al.) Targets physical attacks like Localized and Visible Adversarial Noise (LaVAN) and adversarial patches. Estimates regions with high probability of adversarial noise. Reduces gradient activity in these regions to correctly recognize adversarial examples. Occlusion Method (McCoyd et.al.) Mitigates influence from adversarial patches by partially occluding the image around candidate patch locations. Considered a form of denoising by destroying adversarial patches through occlusion. Adversarial Pixel Masking (APM) Defends against physical attacks, such as adversarial patches. Trains an adversarial pixel mask module to remove patches based on the generated mask. Patch Zero Functions as a denoising strategy. Combines adversarial detection and denoising to tackle adversarial attacks. These methods enhance the robustness of models by either directly removing adversarial perturbations or by combining detection and denoising techniques. The adversarial prompting Add information to offset the negative impact of adversarial perturbations, prompt what labels the models should truly predict via positive injections. Summary of Adversarial Prompting Defense Methods Adversarial Prompting Goal: Achieve defense by adding information to counteract the negative impacts of adversarial perturbations, prompting models towards correct predictions with positive injections. Unadversarial Examples (Salman et.al.) [118] Generates textures with prompting ability in a 3D environment. Creates “robust objects” based on deep models’ input-perturbation-sensitivity. Provides a new approach for physical adversarial defenses. Preemptive Robustification (Moon et.al.) [119] Defends against intercept-and-perturb behaviors in real scenarios. Utilizes a bi-level optimization scheme to discover robust perturbations that can be added to images. Defensive Patch (Wang et.al.) [120] Pre-injects positive patches into instances to aid image recognition. Enhances prompting intensity with strong global perceptual correlations and local identifiable patterns. Effective against both adversarial patches and common corruptions.

By applying the LLL algorithm to this lattice, we can then obtain a set of polynomials with smaller coefficients that share the same roots. Nevertheless, the bivariate case presents an additional challenge - we need to find two distinct polynomials in order to solve for both variables, $x$ and $y$. The general strategy is as follows: Construct a matrix whose rows correspond to the desired polynomial constraints, taking into account Howgrave’s condition. Apply the LLL algorithm to this matrix to obtain a reduced basis, which will include two or more polynomials with smaller coefficients. Analyze the resulting polynomials to identify a pair that can be used to solve for the values of x and y. This approach allows us to find the small roots of bivariate integer polynomials, under Howgrave’s condition. The most significant problem is the structure of our matrix.

Set our target with the form below: $$ p(x,y) = \\sum_{0 \\le i, j \\le \\delta} p_{i,j} x^i y^j $$ Obviously, we note the coefficients as $p_{i,j}$. Remember that our goal is to reduce the coefficients to smaller ones in two independent polynomials letting us to find roots directly with resultant or Gröbner basis. With condition given in Howgrave-Graham, we start to build some polynomials. That is: We are looking for an integer root $(x_0,y_0)$ such that $p(x_0,y_0) = 0$ and with the bound $\\vert x_0 \\vert \\le X, \\vert y_0 \\vert \\le Y$. Assumption 1: $p(x,y)$ is irreducible. Of course, if not , just use the factor as new $p(x,y)$. Fact: shift ploynomials share the same root with our target $F(x,y)$ It’s trivial to attention the fact. In Cor[07] we build. $$ S_{a,b}(x,y) = x^a y^b \\cdot p(x,y) ,\\text{for}\\quad 0 \\le a,b \\lt k \\tag1 $$ $$ r_{i,j}(x,y) = x^i y^j \\cdot n ,\\text{for}\\quad 0 \\le i,b \\lt k+\\delta \\tag2 $$ Matrix $S$ Let $S$ be the matrix of row vectors obtained by taking the coefficients of the polynomials $S_{a,b}(x,y)$ for $0 \\le a, b \\lt k$, (choose $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$ sufficiently large) and consider the $k^2$ polynomials for which we only consider the monomials $x^{i_0 +i}y^{j_0 +j} \\text{for}\\quad 0 \\le i,j \\lt k$, where the index $(i_0,j_0)$ is given. ( $0 \\le i_0,j_0 \\lt \\delta $).

Finally, we can descript our shift polynomial $h(x,y)$ . Let $h(x,y)$ be a linear combination of the polynomials $s_{a,b}(x,y)$ and $r_{i,j}(x,y).$ Since we have that $s_{a,b}(x,y)=0$ mod $n$ for all $a,b$ and $r_{i,j}(x,y)=0 \\mod n$ for all $i,j$,we obtain: $$ h(x_0,y_0)=0 \\mod n. $$ The following lemma, due to Howgrave-Graham [13], shows that if the coefficients of polynomial $h(x,y)$ are sufficiently small, then $h(x_0,y_0)=0$ holds over the integers. For a polynomial $h(x,y)=\\sum_{i,j} h_{ij}x^{i} y^{j}$, we define $\\Vert h(x,y) \\Vert ^2:=\\sum_{i,j}\\vert h_{ij}\\vert^2.$ Lattice $L$ We consider the lattice $L$ generated by the row vectors formed with the coefficients of polynomials $s_{a,b}(xX,yY)$ and $r_{i,j}(xX,yY).$ In total, there are $k^2+(k+\\delta)^2$ such polynomials; moreover these polynomials are of maximum degree $\\delta+k-1$ in $x,y$, so they contain at most $(\\delta + k)^2$ coefficients. Let $M$ be the corresponding matrix of row vectors; $M$ is therefore a rectangular matrix with $k^2+(k+\\delta)^2$ rows and $(k+\\delta)^2$ columns (see Figure 2 for an illustration). Observe that the rows of $M$ do not form a basis of $L$ (because there are more rows than columns), but $L$ is a full rank lattice of dimension $(k+\\delta)^2$ (because the row vectors corresponding to polynomials $r_{i,j}(xX,yY)$ form a full rank lattice). With our idea to find $h(x,y)$, we build $M$. Notice that choosing a block in $M$ can done the task easier. Nonetheless, that’s not enough. Sublattice $L_2$ Formally, we choose the sub lattice $L_2$ with $\\omega$ dimensions $$ \\omega \\coloneqq (\\delta+K)^2 -k^2 = \\delta^2 + 2k\\delta $$ A matrix basis for $L_2$ can be obtained by fırst triangularizing $M$ using elementary row operations and then taking the corresponding submatrix (see Figure 3).

Calculating determinant with elementary rows transformation need some bridge matrix for block matrix computation. With our choosing strategy considered, there is a simplified matrix. Let $M^{\\prime}$ be the same matrix as $M$, except that we take the coefficients of polynomials $S_{a,b}(xX,yY)$ and $r_{i,j}(xX,yY)$; matrix $M^{\\prime}$ has $k^2+ (\\delta + k)^2$ rows and $(k+\\delta)^2$ columns. And we remove the $X^i Y^j$ powers. $$ M^{\\prime} = \\begin{bmatrix} S \u0026 T \\\\ nI_{k^2} \u0026 0 \\\\ 0 \u0026 nI_{\\omega} \\end{bmatrix} $$ Detail: Matrix $S$ is previously defined square matrix of dimension $k^2$, while $T$ is matrix with $k^2$ rows and $\\omega = k^2 + 2k\\delta$ columns. Let $L^\\prime$ be a lattice generated by the rows of $M^{\\prime}$, in other word , we set $L^{\\prime}$ in the row space of the matrix $M^{\\prime}$, and let $L_2^\\prime$ be the sublattice where all coefficients corresponding to monomials $x^{i+i_0}y^{j+j_0}$ for $0 \\le i, j\\lt k$ are set to zero. Note that lattice $L^{\\prime}$ corresponds to lattice $L$ without the $X^iY^j$ powers, whereas lattice $L_2^\\prime$ corresponds to lattice $L_2$. Note that: $$ S^\\prime \\cdot S = n I_{k^2} $$ Namely $S^\\prime$ is (up to sign) the transpose of the co-factor matrix of $S$, verifying $S^\\prime\\cdot S=(\\det S)I_{k^2}.$ of $M^{\\prime}$; this gives the following matrix: $$ M_2’=\\begin{bmatrix}I_{k^2}\u00260\u00260\\\\-S’\u0026I_{k^2}\u00260\\\\0\u00260\u0026I_\\omega\\end{bmatrix}\\cdot M’=\\begin{bmatrix}S\u0026T\\\\0\u0026T’\\\\0\u0026nI_\\omega\\end{bmatrix} $$ where $T^\\prime=-S^{\\prime}\\cdot T$ is a matrix with $k^2$ rows and $\\omega$ columns.

The polynomial $p(x,y)$ being irreducible, the gcd of its coefficients is equal to $1$. The gcd of the coefficients of $p(x,y)$ being 1 implies that the entries of $M^{\\prime}$ are coprime, which allows for the columns of $M^{\\prime}$ to be transformed through elementary operations into an identity matrix block. This is possible because there are no common factors that restrict the linear combinations needed to zero out entries and simplify the matrix. The unimodular transformation preserves the determinant, ensuring that the fundamental properties of the lattice defined by $M^{\\prime}$ are maintained. $$ M_4^\\prime=M^\\prime\\cdot V=\\begin{bmatrix}I_{k^2}| 0\\\\nV\\end{bmatrix} $$ By elementary row operations on $M_4^{\\prime}$ based on $V^-1$ we obtain : $$ M_5^{\\prime}=\\begin{bmatrix}I_{k^2}\u00260\\\\0\u0026V^{-1}\\end{bmatrix}\\cdot M_4’=\\begin{bmatrix}I_{k^2}\u00260\\\\\u0026nI_{(\\delta+k)^2}\\end{bmatrix}=\\begin{bmatrix}I_{k^2}\u00260\\\\ nI_{k^2}\u00260\\\\0\u0026nI_\\omega\\end{bmatrix} $$ $$ M_6^{\\prime}= U^\\prime \\cdot M_5^{\\prime}=\\begin{bmatrix}I_{k^2}\u00260 \\\\ 0 \u0026 n I_\\omega \\\\ 0\u00260\\end{bmatrix} $$ $$ \\det L’=\\det\\begin{bmatrix}I_{k^2}\u00260 \\\\ 0\u0026nI_\\omega\\end{bmatrix}=n^\\omega \\tag5 $$ Combining equations $(4)$ and $(5)$, we obtain: $$ \\det L_2’=n^{\\omega-1} $$ Finally we can recover $\\det L_2$ from $\\det L_2^\\prime$: $$ \\begin{align} \\det L_2\u0026=\\det L_2^{\\prime}\\cdot\\frac{\\prod\\limits_{0\\leq i,j\u003c\\delta+k}X^iY^j}{\\prod\\limits_{0\\leq i,j\u003ck}X^{i_0+i}Y^{j_0+j}} \\\\ \u0026=n^{\\omega-1}\\cdot\\frac{(XY)^{(\\delta+k-1)\\cdot(\\delta+k)^2/2-(k-1)\\cdot k^2/2}}{(X^{i_0}Y^{j_0})^{k^2}}. \\end{align} $$ Remember that calculating the determinant is for our inequality relationship. $$ 2^{(\\omega-1)/4}\\cdot\\det(L_2)^{1/\\omega}\\leq\\frac{n}{\\sqrt{\\omega}} $$ This obtained: $$ 2^{\\omega\\cdot(\\omega-1)/4}\\cdot\\frac{(XY)^{","date":"2024-06-04","objectID":"/waytocoppersmith0x01/:3:2","tags":[],"title":"WayToCoppersmith0x01","uri":"/waytocoppersmith0x01/"},{"categories":[],"content":"Summary As usual we consider shifts of the polynomial $F(x, y)$.

(The most technical part is proving that this can always be done and bounding the size of $M$.) One can now consider the $(d+k)^2$ polynomials $Mx^iy^j$ for $0\\leq i,j\u003cd+k.$ Writing each polynomial as a row vector of coefficients, we now have a $k^2+(d+k)^2$ by $(d+k)^2$ matrix.

Lattice basis reduction yields a short vector that corresponds to a polynomial $G(x,y)$ with small coefficients such that every root of $F(x,y)$ is a root of $G(x,y)$ modulo $M.$ If $(x_0,y_0)$ is a sufficiently small solution to $F(x,y)$ then, one infers that $G(x_0,y_0)=0$ over $\\mathbb{Z}.$ $G(x,y)$ has no common factor with $F(x,y)$.

This method returns small roots of this polynomial modulo some factor `b` of `N` with the constraint that `b \u003e= N^\\beta`. Small in this context means that if `x` is a root of `f` modulo `b` then `|x| \u003c X`. This `X` is either provided by the user or the maximum `X` is chosen such that this algorithm terminates in polynomial time. If `X` is chosen automatically it is `X = ceil(1/2 N^{\\beta^2/\\delta - \\epsilon})`. The algorithm may also return some roots which are larger than `X`. 'This algorithm' in this context means Coppersmith's algorithm for finding small roots using the LLL algorithm. The implementation of this algorithm follows Alexander May's PhD thesis referenced below. INPUT: - ``X`` -- an absolute bound for the root (default: see above) - ``beta`` -- compute a root mod `b` where `b` is a factor of `N` and `b \\ge N^\\beta`. (Default: 1.0, so `b = N`.) - ``epsilon`` -- the parameter `\\epsilon` described above. (Default: `\\beta/8`) - ``**kwds`` -- passed through to method :meth:`Matrix_integer_dense.LLL() \u003csage.matrix.matrix_integer_dense.Matrix_integer_dense.LLL\u003e`. EXAMPLES: First consider a small example:: sage: N = 10001 sage: K = Zmod(10001) sage: P.\u003cx\u003e = PolynomialRing(K, implementation='NTL') sage: f = x^3 + 10*x^2 + 5000*x - 222 This polynomial has no roots without modular reduction (i.e. over `\\ZZ`):: sage: f.change_ring(ZZ).roots() [] To compute its roots we need to factor the modulus `N` and use the Chinese remainder theorem:: sage: p,q = N.prime_divisors() sage: f.change_ring(GF(p)).roots() [(4, 1)] sage: f.change_ring(GF(q)).roots() [(4, 1)] sage: crt(4, 4, p, q) 4 This root is quite small compared to `N`, so we can attempt to recover it without factoring `N` using Coppersmith's small root method:: sage: f.small_roots() [4] An application of this method is to consider RSA. We are using 512-bit RSA with public exponent `e=3` to encrypt a 56-bit DES key. Because it would be easy to attack this setting if no padding was used we pad the key `K` with 1s to get a large number:: sage: Nbits, Kbits = 512, 56 sage: e = 3 We choose two primes of size 256-bit each:: sage: p = 2^256 + 2^8 + 2^5 + 2^3 + 1 sage: q = 2^256 + 2^8 + 2^5 + 2^3 + 2^2 + 1 sage: N = p*q sage: ZmodN = Zmod( N ) We choose a random key:: sage: K = ZZ.random_element(0, 2^Kbits) and pad it with 512-56=456 1s:: sage: Kdigits = K.digits(2) sage: M = [0]*Kbits + [1]*(Nbits-Kbits) sage: for i in range(len(Kdigits)): M[i] = Kdigits[i] sage: M = ZZ(M, 2) Now we encrypt the resulting message:: sage: C = ZmodN(M)^e To recover `K` we consider the following polynomial modulo `N`:: sage: P.\u003cx\u003e = PolynomialRing(ZmodN, implementation='NTL') sage: f = (2^Nbits - 2^Kbits + x)^e - C and recover its small roots:: sage: Kbar = f.small_roots()[0] sage: K == Kbar True The same algorithm can be used to factor `N = pq` if partial knowledge about `q` is available. This example is from the Magma handbook: First, we set up `p`, `q` and `N`:: sage: length = 512 sage: hidden = 110 sage: p = next_prime(2^int(round(length/2))) sage: q = next_prime( round(pi.n()*p) ) sage: N = p*q Now we disturb the low 110 bits of `q`:: sage: qbar = q + ZZ.random_element(0,2^hidden-1) And try to recover `q` from it:: sage: F.\u003cx\u003e = PolynomialRing(Zmod(N), implementation='NTL') sage: f = x - qbar We know that the error is `\\le 2^{\\text{hidden}}-1` and that the modulus we are looking for is `\\ge \\sqrt{N}`:: sage: from sage.misc.verbose import set_verbose sage: set_verbose(2) sage: d = f.small_roots(X=2^hidden-1, beta=0.5)[0] # time random verbose 2 (\u003cmodule\u003e) m = 4 verbose 2 (\u003cmodule\u003e) t = 4 verbose 2 (\u003cmodule\u003e) X = 1298074214633706907132624082305023 verbose 1 (\u003cmodule\u003e) LLL of 8x8 matrix (algorithm fpLLL:wrapper) verbo","date":"2024-05-26","objectID":"/waytocoppersmith-0x00/:8:0","tags":[],"title":"WayToCoppersmith0x00","uri":"/waytocoppersmith-0x00/"},{"categories":[],"content":" Regev讲义学习笔记 ","date":"2024-05-26","objectID":"/lattice-part-1/:0:0","tags":[],"title":"Lattice Part 1","uri":"/lattice-part-1/"},{"categories":[],"content":"Everything Before ​ 我们的目标是求解近似求解SVP问题，基于此构建了一个具有特殊结构的基，为了构建这样的代数结构，设计出一类规约算法，并验证了正确性和时间复杂度的可行性。基于这样的思路，可以在规约算法上进行优化，在代数结构上进行调整，获得更好的近似求解表现。 ​ 在具有这样的清晰思路后，再来考虑代数工具的构建，将会使工作更加完善。 ","date":"2024-05-26","objectID":"/lattice-part-1/:1:0","tags":[],"title":"Lattice Part 1","uri":"/lattice-part-1/"},{"categories":[],"content":"Reduced Basis 注意到 将一个普通正交基，规约为一个约简基总是可以的。 给出这样的定义，实则是基于我们的研究对象一些代数上表现良好的结构，使得可以很好的利用这样的约简基，配合闵可夫斯基界，我们可以给出一个SVP的近似求解，对于近似精度，我们再利用参数 $\\delta$ 来进行很好的刻画，在后面的学习中将会看到这里的 $\\delta = \\frac{3}{4}$ 时，会得到一个非常良好的规约结果。 利用简单的三角不等式: $$ \\begin{cases} \\delta{\\Vert\\tilde{b_{i}}\\Vert}^{2}\\leq{\\Vert\\mu_{i+1,i}\\tilde{b_{i}}+\\tilde{b_{i+1}}\\Vert}^{2}=\\mu_{i+1,i}^{2}{\\Vert\\tilde{b_{i}}\\Vert}^{2}+{\\Vert\\tilde{b_{i+1}}\\Vert}^{2} \\tag{1} \\\\ \\Vert\\tilde{b_{i+1}}\\Vert^2\\geq(\\delta-\\mu_{i+1,i}^2)\\Vert\\tilde{b_i}\\Vert^2\\geq(\\delta-\\frac{1}{4})\\Vert\\tilde{b_i}\\Vert^2 \\end{cases} $$ 实际上，我们的格工作在 $p$ 范数空间。 进一步的,$(1)$，说明了两个相邻基向量不会相差太大 Schmit process中，不难发现， 所得到的基向量列向量优先可以得到，如下矩阵 即 从 $$ \\tilde{b_i}=b_i-\\sum_{j=1}^{i-1}\\mu_{i,j}\\tilde{b_j},where\\mu_{i,j}=\\frac{\\langle b_i,\\tilde{b_j}\\rangle}{\\langle\\tilde{b_j},\\tilde{b_j}\\rangle}. $$ 到如下矩阵的一个转变 $$ \\begin{pmatrix}\\Vert\\tilde{b_1}\\Vert\u0026 * \u0026\\cdots\u0026 * \\\\ 0\u0026\\Vert\\tilde{b_2}\\Vert\u0026\\cdots\u0026 * \\\\ \\vdots\u0026\u0026\\ddots\u0026\\vdots \\\\ \u0026\u0026\u0026 * \\\\ 0\u0026\\cdots\u0026\u0026\\Vert\\tilde{b_n}\\Vert\\end{pmatrix} $$ 当 $\\delta = \\frac{3}{4}$ 时，所得矩阵概览便为： $$ \\begin{pmatrix}\\Vert\\tilde{b_1}\\Vert\u0026\\leq\\frac12\\Vert\\tilde{b_1}\\Vert\u0026\\cdots\u0026\u0026\\leq\\frac12\\Vert\\tilde{b_1}\\Vert \\\\ 0\u0026\\Vert\\tilde{b_2}\\Vert\u0026\\cdots\u0026\u0026\\leq\\frac12\\Vert\\tilde{b_2}\\Vert \\\\ \\vdots\u0026\u0026\\ddots\u0026\u0026\\vdots \\\\ \u0026\u0026\u0026\u0026\\leq\\frac12\\Vert\\tilde{b_{n-1}}\\Vert \\\\ 0\u0026\\cdots\u0026\u0026\u0026\\Vert\\tilde{b_n}\\Vert\\end{pmatrix} $$ 以上的工作均是在 Gram-Schmit 做微调下，实现这样的结果，但是直到现在我们尚未把所做工作同 SVP-approximation 联系起来。 ","date":"2024-05-26","objectID":"/lattice-part-1/:2:0","tags":[],"title":"Lattice Part 1","uri":"/lattice-part-1/"},{"categories":[],"content":"What can LLL do?

0}^{n-1}(x-x_{i})$$。 已知$n-1$, 那么各个$x_{i}$均已知，行列式系数范德蒙矩阵可知。 若已知$y_{i}$则求系数问题可转化为线性方程组求解问题。 真对上述问题作变式： $n-1$ 、序列$1,2,3,\\dots,x_{n-1}$,$y_{0},\\dots,y_{n-1}$,已知，可唯一确定多项式。 那么可以知晓，拉格朗日插值可求得范德蒙矩阵的逆矩阵。 范德蒙矩阵的拉格朗日逆 拉格朗日插值根据多项式的点值表示，以及多项式次数唯一确定多项式系数。 $$V ·A = Y$$ 即根据Vandermonde矩阵，点值向量$V,Y$确定系数向量$A=(a_{0},\\dots ,a_{n})$ $$A = V^{-1}Y$$ 本节将会探究这样求值的具体形式化表达。

形式上来看似乎是一个LCG相关问题 $$ x_{n+1} = x_{n}a + b \\pmod{p} $$ 问题在于r = getrandbits(20) 似乎无法预测，然而可以从数列的角度简单理解一下这道题。 这个oracle ，输入初始值$x_{0}$，然后预测$x_{r}$，预测成功并将我们设计得到的$x_{r}$（代码中设计为y）输入。 关键变量r也未知，那么可以考虑不动点解法。 先看一组式子： $$ \\begin{cases} x_{0} \u0026= x_{0} \\\\ x_{1} \u0026= ax_{0}+b \\\\ x_{2} \u0026= a^{2}x_{0}+b(a+1) \\\\ x_{3} \u0026= a^{3}x_{0}+b(a^2+a+1) \\end{cases} $$ $$ x_{n} = a^{n}x_{0}+ b\\left( \\sum^{n-1}_{i=0}a^{i} \\right) $$ 注意到 $$ \\frac{a^{n}-1}{a-1}= \\left( \\sum^{n-1}_{i=0} a^{i} \\right) $$ , 实际上可以写出一个较为简洁的关于第$n$项和首项的公式： $$ x_{n} = a^{n}x_{0}+ b\\frac{a^{n}-1}{a-1} $$ 这就符合我们控制的两个输入和输出。 首先不考虑模运算的存在，一个较好的情况是$x_{n}=x_{0},n=r$，$r$未知，那么考虑消除$r$对我们的影响： $$\\begin{aligned} \\frac{x_{r}}{x_{0}}\u0026=a^{r}+\\frac{b}{x_{0}} \\frac{a^{r}-1}{a-1}\\\\ 1\u0026=a^{r}+\\frac{b}{x_{0}} \\frac{a^{r}-1}{a-1} \\end{aligned}$$ OK，到了这里我们发现等式右边由$a^{n}$和一个系数$\\frac{b}{x_{0}}$控制的$a^{n}$构成，那么一个平凡的想法就是考虑两个系数互为相反数,那么尝试一下我们刚好发现等式恒成立。 令$\\frac{b}{x_{0}} \\frac{1}{a-1}=-1$ $$x_{0}= - \\frac{b}{a-1}$$ 代入恰好得： $$1 = a^{r}-(a^{r}-1)=1$$ 那么此时，只要已知$a,b$令$x_{0}=- \\frac{b}{a-1}$，这个递推数列就变成了常数数列，再考虑模运算自然也是无伤大雅。 from pwn import * conn = remote('be.ax', 31800) #

为了便于表示，我们引入$J_{i}$表示jumps中的第$i$个数，$S_{i}$表示jumps中的前$n$项和，显然地，我们得到： $J_{1}=5,J_{2}=3,\\dots;S_{0}=0,S_{1}=5,S_{2}=3\\dots$ 根据 def f(s): return (a * s + b) % p jumps = sample(range(3, 25), 12) output =

O_{i}=f_{S_{i}}(s)= a^{S_{i}}s+ b \\frac{a^{S_{i}}-1}{a-1} \\pmod{p} $$ 那么对于12=len(jumps)个输出值和指数，我们得到了一簇$l=12$个方程。 在$\\mod{p}$的情况下，常见的思路就是加减消元。 不难观察到， $$a^{69} = \\frac{O_{9}-O_{6}}{O_{3}-O_{1}} \\pmod{p} \\tag{1}$$ 如果能够找到另外一个$a^{k}$,就给了我们进一步作差的思路: 如果能够找到两个式子$f_{1},f_{2}$满足: $$\\begin{cases} f_{1} = 0 \\\\ f_{2} = 0 \\end{cases} \\pmod{p}$$ 那么可以获得$k_{1}p=(f_{1},f_{2})$,那么此时的$k_{1}$相对小，可以通过可以接受的枚举，恢复出最终模数$p$. 对于$(1)$式，这样的一组$a^k,i_{1},i_{2},i_{3},i_{4}$ 对于$l=12$的情况，考虑枚举，来获得我们想要的 $$a^{k}= \\frac{O_{i_{1}}-O_{i_{2}}}{O_{i_{3}}-O_{i_{3}}}

Point","uri":"/fix-point/"},{"categories":[],"content":"分式线性变换的概念与分式线性递推式的不动点解法由来 定义：具有以下形式的函数$f:\\mathbb{C} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}$,称为分式线性变换（linear fractional transformation): $$f(x) = \\frac{Ax+B}{Cx+D}\\quad(A,B,C,D \\in \\mathbb{C},AD-BC \\ne 0)$$ 因为德国数学家奥古斯特·莫比乌斯曾对其进行过大量研究，所以分式线性变换也叫做莫比乌斯变换（Möbius transformation） 因式分解后可把$f(x)$写成： $$f(x)=\\frac{BC-AD}C\\frac1{Cx+D}+\\frac AC$$ 可以验证在实数域上，这是一个可逆变换，具有以下性质： $y=f(x)$的逆变换为$x= \\frac{-Dy+B}{Cy-A}$。 一次函数是一个特殊情况。 分式线性变换之间的复合结果仍然是分式线性变换。 根据不动点的性质，对于变换及其逆变换，不动点一一对应。 为什么两边同时减去不动点？ 按照待定系数法的思路，假定对分式线性变换解析式的$f(x)$两侧同时减去某个合适的常数P再同时取倒数后，能得到形式一致的分母。先 $$ \\begin{aligned}\u0026\\text{做第一步减法,得:}\\\\\u0026a_{n+1}-P=\\frac{Aa_n+B}{Ca_n+D}-P=\\frac{Aa_n+B-PCa_n-DP}{Ca_n+D}=\\frac{(A-PC)a_n+(B-DP)}{Ca_n+D}\\end{aligned} $$ 要使上面的式子取倒数后的分母满足要求，由于分母取倒数前是位于分子的位置，基于前面的解题实例可知，我们只需要保证上式最左边的量与最右边的分子形式相似即可。 即只需要使$a_{n+1}-P$与$(A-PC)a_n+(B-DP)$的对应系数成相同比例即可。即： $$\\begin{aligned}\\frac{1}{A-PC}=\\frac{-P}{B-DP}\\end{aligned}$$ $$P=\\frac{B-DP}{CP-A}$$ 显然，这个所需的P值是$f(x)$的反函数的不动点。根据前面总结的性质，可知P也是$f(x)$的不动点。 即对$f(x)$两侧同时减去其不动点后，再取同时倒数，就一定能构造出一次的常系数非齐次递推式。 桥函数 上述推导，无论赛题或概念都在中间利用了大量中间函数。 考虑到分式线性变换性质3.，我们继续探究： 首先由于一次函数属于特殊的分式线性变换，而且分式线性变换是可逆变化，所以自然想到能否将分式线性递推式还原为某种更简单的一次线性递推式的形式。求出与之相关的一次线性递推式的迭代结果后，再利用逆变换反推出原递推式的多次迭代结果。 另一方面，我们已经知道使用不动点法可以简化一次线性递推式的求解，我们希望将不动点也整合到分式线性变换还原为线性递推式的系数配凑过程中。 定义: 使得$f(x)$可以与另一个函数$g(x)$建立下列联系的可逆函数$T(x)$叫做桥函数： $$f(x)= T^{-1}(g(T(x)))$$ 此时，$f(x)$和$g(x)$叫做关于桥函数$T(x)$的一对相似函数,或者说$f(x)$和$g(x)$关于桥函数$T(x)$互为相似函数。 用拓扑学术语来说，桥函数是一种同胚变换(homeomorphism) 它建立了$f(x)$和$g(x)$之间的拓扑共轭(topological conjugacy) 笔者的拓扑记忆也是较为模糊，如有疏漏欢迎勘误。 桥函数是计算函数迭代或构造数列的辅助函数。 通过找到合适的桥函数，将不易得到迭代公式的$f(x)$转化为容易得到迭代公式的形式更简单的$g(x)$, 计算完$g(x)$的$n$次迭代后，再使用桥函数的逆变换（性质保证逆变换一定存在）。应用这种思路把函数迭代问题转化为寻找一个良好的桥函数问题。 那么很容易的，可以得到使用不动点法的动机： 借住不动点，可以探测目标桥函数的一些性质，以便确定桥函数的待定系数。只要确定了待定系数的细节，就可以通过相似变换的方法得到原函数的$n$次迭代式。

假设$f(x)=T^{-1}(g(T(x)))$,且$x_{0}$是$f(x)$的不动点，那么$T(x_{0})$一定也会是$g(x)$的不动点。这说明，如果求出$f(x)$的不动点，并且找到结构合适的$T(x)$，那么$g(x)$的不动点是不言自明的。 通常为了便于求解$g(x)$的$n$次迭代式，可以尝试将$g(x)$取为如下形式： $$\\begin{aligned} \u0026\\bullet g(x) =x+a \\\\ \u0026\\bullet g(x) =ax \\\\ \u0026\\bullet g(x) =ax^2 \\\\ \u0026\\bullet g(x) =ax^3 \\end{aligned}$$ 对于这几种情况，$g(x)$的不动点为0或$\\infty$。此时如果$f(x)$只有唯一的不动点a，可以考虑取$g(x)=x-a$或$g(x)=\\frac1{x-a}$;如果$f(x)$有2个相异的不动点a和b，则可以考虑取$g(x)=\\frac{x-a}{x-b}$。 这样的桥函数思想是优美的。 另举一例 (from TSG-CTF 2023) import os import

Policy）是一种安全机制，用于限制一个源（域名、协议和端口号的组合）的文档或脚本如何与其他源的资源进行交互。同源策略的目的是防止恶意网站通过脚本等方式获取用户的敏感信息或进行恶意操作。 同源策略的限制包括以下几个方面： Cookie、LocalStorage和IndexDB等存储机制的限制：同源的文档可以共享这些存储机制，但不同源的文档无法访问彼此的存储数据。 DOM操作的限制：同源的文档可以通过JavaScript等脚本访问彼此的DOM元素，但不同源的文档无法访问彼此的DOM元素。 AJAX请求的限制：同源的文档可以通过XMLHttpRequest等方式进行AJAX请求，但不同源的文档无法进行跨域AJAX请求。 需要注意的是，同源策略只限制浏览器端的交互，服务器端不存在同源策略的限制。如果需要进行跨域交互，可以使用一些特殊的技术手段，如JSONP、CORS、代理服务器等。 ","date":"2024-04-04","objectID":"/jwt-note/:0:0","tags":[],"title":"Jwt

Note","uri":"/jwt-note/"},{"categories":[],"content":"session 和 jwt Session模式和JWT模式都是常见的身份验证和授权机制，二者有以下几点不同： 存储方式不同：Session模式将用户身份信息存储在服务端的内存或者数据库中，而JWT模式将用户身份信息存储在客户端的浏览器中。 状态管理方式不同：Session模式需要服务端在每次请求中校验用户的身份信息，而JWT模式则不需要服务端校验，只需要在客户端解密和校验即可。 扩展性不同：Session模式需要在服务端存储用户身份信息，因此需要考虑存储容量和扩展性等问题，而JWT模式不需要存储用户身份信息，因此具有更好的扩展性。 跨语言支持不同：Session模式需要服务端和客户端使用相同的编程语言实现，而JWT模式可以跨越多种编程语言和平台。 安全性不同：Session模式存在一定的安全风险，如会话劫持、会话固定等问题，而JWT模式可以通过加密和签名等方式提高安全性。 总的来说，Session模式适用于单一的应用程序，而JWT模式适用于多个应用程序或者服务之间的信息传输。 Token 的使用 用户信息加密填入 token 中，服务器不保存任何用户信息，保存密钥信息，通过使用特定加密算法验证 token。 client – uid+passwd 请求 sever – 收到并验证 sever – 验证成功后签发 token 并将 token 返回客户端 client – 请求服务器资源需要附带 token （在 cookie 或 header 中携带） sever – 收到请求核验 token，成功则返回所请求数据 基于token的认证方式相对于session认证方式更加节约服务器资源，对移动端和分布式更友好。 支持跨域访问。token不使用cookie而直接放入请求头中，跨域后不存储信息丢失。 无状态：token机制在服务端不储存session信息，token自身携带登录用户的信息。 更加适用CDN: 可以通过分发网络请求服务端的所有资料。 更适用于移动端：当客户端时非浏览器平台时，cookie不被支持，而token可以实现。 无需考虑CSRF: 由于不再依赖cookie,token认证不会发生CSRF无需考虑CSRF的防御。 CRSF（Cross-Site Request Forgery）是一种网络攻击方式，攻击者通过伪造用户已经授权过的请求来执行恶意操作。攻击者通常会通过诱骗用户点击链接或访问网站来实现攻击。CRSF攻击可以导致用户的账户被盗、信息泄露等安全问题。 CDN（Content Delivery Network）是一种分布式网络架构，通过在全球各地部署服务器节点，将静态资源（如图片、视频、脚本等）缓存在离用户最近的服务器上，从而提高资源访问速度和用户体验。CDN的主要功能包括：加速访问速度、提高网站可用性、降低服务器负载、保障安全性等。通过使用CDN，网站可以更快地响应用户请求，减少带宽消耗和服务器压力，提高网站的稳定性和安全性。 Json Web Token JWT的本质是一个字符串。它将用户信息保存到一个Json字符串中，然后进行编码后得到一个JWT token，并且这个JWT token带有签名信息，接收后可以校验是否被篡改，所以可以用于在各方之间安全地将信息作为Json对象传输。 JWT的认证流程如下： Session Session 的抽象概念是会话，是无状态协议通信过程中，为了实现中断/继续操作，将用户和服务器之间的交互进行的一种抽象；具体来说，是服务器生成的一种 Session 结构，可以通过多种方式保存，如内存、数据库、文件等，大型网站一般有专门的 Session 服务器集群来保存用户会话。 session 是另一种记录服务器和客户端会话的机制。 session 是基于cookie 实现的，session 存储在服务器端，session ID 会被 cookie 保存到客户端的 cookie 中。 服务器执行 session 机制时，生成 session ID 发送客户端，客户端请求将 ID 加入 http 发送服务端，ID 本地保存，容器为 cookie，因此 ban 掉 cookie 时，session 不能正确使用。 session ID 在服务端 进行匹配。 cookie 客户端保存用户信息的一种机制，用来记录用户信息。服务器存储在本地机器上的一小段文本，会被下一次请求携带发往服务器。 cookie 不可跨越，每个 cookie 绑定单一域名，无法在别的域名下使用，一级域名和二级域名互通，（凭借 domain） cookie 会根据上 http 响应报文中的的 set-cookie 的首部字段信息，通知客户端保存 cookie。当下客户端再向服务端发起请求时，cookie 自动加入。 属性： Http协议是一种无状态的协议 http 无状态的协议 （对于事务处理无记忆功能，对话完成后，服务端不保存任何会话信息。） 每一个 http 完全独立 服务端无法 确认当前访问者的身份信息，无法分辨上一次的请求发送者和这一次的是否相同。下一次请求时，仍然需要认证。为了解决这个问题，提出了cookie的解决方案： Session的一些问题 每个用户的登录信息都会保存到服务器的session中，随着用户的增多，服务器开销会明显增大 由于session是存在与服务器的物理内存中，所以在分布式系统中，这种方式将会失效。虽然可以将session统一保存到Redis中，但是这样做无疑增加了系统的复杂性，对于不需要redis的应用也会白白多引入一个缓存中间件 无cookie时失效，例如非浏览器的移动端、手机移动端等等。 cookie截获导致的CSRF 中间件的存在导致消息可能转发多次 后端部署复杂 由于cookie的不可跨域性，session的认证也无法跨域，不适用于单点登录（SSO） 单点登录（Single Sign-On，简称SSO）是一种身份认证机制，允许用户使用一组凭据（如用户名和密码）登录到多个应用程序或系统中，而无需为每个应用程序单独进行身份验证。在SSO中，用户只需进行一次登录，就可以访问多个应用程序，从而提高用户体验和工作效率。SSO通常使用集中式认证服务来管理用户身份信息和授权访问权限，例如OAuth、OpenID Connect等。SSO的优势包括降低密码管理成本、提高安全性、增强用户体验等。 跨域认证（Cross-Origin Authentication）是指在不同域之间进行身份认证的过程。由于同源策略的限制，不同域之间的页面无法直接访问彼此的Cookie信息，因此跨域认证需要使用特殊的技术手段来实现。常见的跨域认证方式包括OAuth、OpenID Connect等。OAuth是一种基于令牌的授权机制，允许用户授权第三方应用程序访问其资源，而无需将用户名和密码直接提供给第三方应用程序。OpenID Connect是基于OAuth 2.0的身份验证协议，提供了一种标准化的方式来验证用户身份和授权访问权限。通过使用这些跨域认证技术，应用程序可以安全地进行跨域身份认证，提高用户体验和安全性。 Jwt认证的一些优势 数据量小，传输迅速 Json加密形式保存在客户端，可跨语言，原则上支持各种web形式。 无需在服务器保存会话信息。 适用于分布式、移动端 SSO友好 故常见的分布式应用和单点式应用更加适合JWT。 Zero Turst 传统的Session和JWT权限管理方式都是基于令牌的方式，而零信任权限管理则更加注重身份验证和访问控制。在零信任模型中，每个用户和设备都需要进行身份验证，并且需要对其进行访问控制，以确保只有经过授权的用户和设备可以访问受保护的资源。与传统的Session和JWT相比，零信任权限管理更加安全和可靠，因为它采用了多层次的安全防护措施，包括身份验证、访问控制、数据加密等。同时，零信任权限管理还可以实现更细粒度的访问控制，以确保每个用户和设备只能访问其需要的资源，从而提高了系统的安全性和可靠性。 Jwt的结构 JWT由三部分构成：Header+Payload+Signature. 传输时，各部分分别base64编码后以.连接，形成最终传输字符串。 每部分对应作用： header和payload可以可解码出原文，获得哈希签名和有效数据。此处有效数据可以另行加密。 signature使用散列函数，无法解码，用于校验token是否有所修改： 校验过程： header中获取加密算法，利用算法加上SecretKey对header、payload进行加密，比对加密后的数据和客户端发送来的是否一致。主一般对于md5系列，SecretKey代表盐值。 ","date":"2024-04-04","objectID":"/jwt-note/:2:0","tags":[],"title":"Jwt

JWT可以使用暴力穷举来破解，所以为了应对这种破解方式，哈希签名密钥(盐值)需要添加生命周期。 Jwt的特点 JWT 默认是不加密，但也是可以加密的。生成原始 Token 以后，可以用密钥再加密一次。 JWT 不加密的情况下，不能将秘密数据写入 JWT。 JWT 不仅可以用于认证，也可以用于交换信息。有效使用 JWT，可以降低服务器查询数据库的次数。 JWT 的最大缺点是，由于服务器不保存 session 状态，因此无法在使用过程中废止某个 token，或者更改 token 的权限。也就是说，一旦 JWT 签发了，在到期之前就会始终有效，除非服务器部署额外的逻辑。 JWT 本身包含了认证信息，一旦泄露，任何人都可以获得该令牌的所有权限。为了减少盗用，JWT 的有效期应该设置得比较短。对于一些比较重要的权限，使用时应该再次对用户进行认证。 为了减少盗用，JWT 不应该使用 HTTP 协议明码传输，要使用 HTTPS 协议传输。 References 阮一峰の博客 官方文档 零信任安全框架-奇安信 IBM的介绍 How2Use ","date":"2024-04-04","objectID":"/jwt-note/:7:0","tags":[],"title":"Jwt
